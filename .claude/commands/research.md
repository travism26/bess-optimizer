# Research

Research the codebase to understand architecture, documentation, and impact analysis for upcoming changes.

## Variables

adw_id: $1
prompt: $2

## Instructions

- If adw_id or prompt is not provided, stop and ask the user to provide them
- Research the codebase iteratively:
  1. Find architecture diagrams and documentation (app_docs/, README files)
  2. Identify relevant source files based on the prompt
  3. Map component dependencies and connections
  4. Analyze what the change will affect
- Create research document at: `ai_docs/research/{adw_id}-{descriptive-name}.md`
  - Replace `{descriptive-name}` with a short, descriptive name based on the research topic (e.g., "auth-system-analysis", "api-structure-mapping", "database-schema-review")
- Use Explore agents for thorough codebase search
- Multiple iterations are expected - be thorough

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Documentation Discovery

- Search for README files across the codebase
- Look in `app_docs/` for existing documentation
- Find architecture diagrams or design documents
- Check `.claude/` for configuration and command patterns

### Phase 2: Source Code Exploration

- Identify files and modules related to the prompt
- Trace imports and dependencies
- Find existing patterns and conventions
- Note any tests that cover the relevant areas

### Phase 3: Impact Analysis

- Determine what will need to change
- Identify dependencies (what depends on affected code)
- Find integration points with other systems
- Note potential risks or considerations
